# About Me

I’m Paggie, a Master of Data Science graduate with a background in programming and commerce. I currently work as a software engineer at the University of Adelaide. I’m outgoing and love the outdoors—I enjoy sports, especially table tennis, badminton, and pickleball. I also go to the gym regularly and like to challenge myself in many ways.

This platform is a space to share who I’ve been in the past and what I want to achieve in the future—all for leisure and fun. I’m happy to meet you all!
